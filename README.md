# publicgoods-scripts
Bash and Javascript scripts to generate the static site for the [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) from a WordPress site. The scripts on this repo are not meant to be used directly, but rather used in the creation of automatic builds through a Continuous Integration (CI) framework, such as a [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/).

This is one of four interconnected repositories; refer to the [publicgoods-website](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-website) for an overview.
